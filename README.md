> the modified Kumaraswamy seasonal autoregressive moving average model with exogenous regressors (MKSARMAX) called mkarma function,
> the sample generator from modified Kumaraswamy autoregressive moving average model called sample.mkarma function, and
> the selection model algorithm to MKSARMAX model, called auto.mkarma function.
For an application example, please open the file "example.R".
